# Select a Specific Version for a Model

MakeHub allows you to specify which version of a model you want to use for your requests. This is particularly useful when you need consistency in your application or when you want to use a specific version that has been thoroughly tested with your use case.

## Default Behavior: Latest Version

By default, when you specify a model without a version, MakeHub routes your request to the latest available version of that model. For example, if you specify `openai/gpt-4o`, MakeHub will use the latest version of GPT-4o available from OpenAI.

```python
# This will use the latest version of GPT-4o
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's new in machine learning?"}
    ]
)
```

## Specifying a Version

To use a specific version of a model, simply append the version date to the model name using a hyphen. For example, to use the August 6, 2024 version of GPT-4o:

```python
# This will use the specific version from August 6, 2024
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's new in machine learning?"}
    ]
)
```

## Version Format

The version format typically follows the provider's versioning scheme. Most commonly, this is a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, but it may vary depending on the provider.

Here are some examples of how to specify versions for different providers:

### OpenAI

```python
# OpenAI models with specific versions
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

### Anthropic

```python
# Anthropic models with specific versions
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-2.1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

## Available Versions

To see all available versions for each model, visit [makehub.ai/models](https://makehub.ai/models). This page provides a comprehensive list of all supported models and their available versions.

## TypeScript Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "your_makehub_api_key",
  baseURL: "https://api.makehub.ai/v1"
});

async function main() {
  // Using the latest version
  const responseLatest = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4o",
    messages: [
      {role: "user", content: "Summarize the latest advances in AI"}
    ]
  });
  
  // Using a specific version
  const responseSpecific = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages: [
      {role: "user", content: "Summarize the latest advances in AI"}
    ]
  });
}

main();
```

## cURL Example

```bash
# Using the latest version
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_makehub_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the latest advances in AI"}
    ]
  }'

# Using a specific version
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_makehub_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the latest advances in AI"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Best Practices for Version Management

Here are some recommended practices for managing model versions in your applications:

1. **Development and Testing**: Use specific versions during development and testing to ensure consistent behavior.

2. **Production**: For production environments, you may want to:
   - Use a specific version to ensure stability and predictable behavior
   - Or use the latest version to benefit from improvements and updates

3. **Version Transitions**: When transitioning from one version to another, test thoroughly and consider implementing a gradual rollout.

4. **Documentation**: Document which model versions your application has been tested with to make troubleshooting easier.

## Version Compatibility

While MakeHub handles the routing to specific versions, it's important to note that different versions of a model may have different capabilities, limitations, or response characteristics. Always test your application with the specific model version you intend to use in production.
