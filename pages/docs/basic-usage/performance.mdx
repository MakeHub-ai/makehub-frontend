# Adding Performance Constraints

MakeHub allows you to optimize your requests based on specific performance requirements. By adding performance constraints to your requests, you can ensure that your API calls are routed to providers that meet your latency and throughput needs.

## Available Performance Constraints

MakeHub supports two primary performance constraints:

1. **`max_latency`**: The maximum acceptable response time (in milliseconds)
2. **`min_throughput`**: The minimum acceptable throughput (in tokens per second)

## Using the "best" Value

For each constraint, you can either:

- Specify a numeric value (e.g., `max_latency: 500` for a maximum of 500ms latency)
- Use the special value `"best"` to automatically route to the provider with the best performance for that metric

When you use `"best"`, MakeHub will analyze real-time performance data across all compatible providers and route your request to the one with the lowest latency or highest throughput, depending on which constraint you're optimizing for.

## Examples

### Python Example

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="your_makehub_api_key",
    base_url="https://api.makehub.ai/v1"
)

# Example 1: Route to the provider with the lowest latency
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
    ],
    extra_query={
        "max_latency": "best"  # Route to provider with lowest latency
    }
)

# Example 2: Route to the provider with the highest throughput
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-3-opus",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story about space exploration"}
    ],
    extra_query={
        "min_throughput": "best"  # Route to provider with highest throughput
    }
)

# Example 3: Combine both constraints
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="mistral/mistral-large",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the history of artificial intelligence"}
    ],
    extra_query={
        "max_latency": "best",    # Lowest latency
        "min_throughput": "best"  # Highest throughput
    }
)

# Example 4: Specify numeric constraints
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Provide tips for improving code efficiency"}
    ],
    extra_query={
        "max_latency": 300,    # Maximum 300ms latency
        "min_throughput": 15   # Minimum 15 tokens per second
    }
)
```

### TypeScript Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "your_makehub_api_key",
  baseURL: "https://api.makehub.ai/v1"
});

async function main() {
  // Example 1: Route to the provider with the lowest latency
  const response1 = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4",
    messages: [
      {role: "user", content: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
    ],
    extra_query: {
      max_latency: "best"  // Route to provider with lowest latency
    }
  });
  
  // Example 2: Route to the provider with the highest throughput
  const response2 = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "anthropic/claude-3-opus",
    messages: [
      {role: "user", content: "Write a short story about space exploration"}
    ],
    extra_query: {
      min_throughput: "best"  // Route to provider with highest throughput
    }
  });
  
  // Example 3: Combine both constraints
  const response3 = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "mistral/mistral-large",
    messages: [
      {role: "user", content: "Summarize the history of artificial intelligence"}
    ],
    extra_query: {
      max_latency: "best",    // Lowest latency
      min_throughput: "best"  // Highest throughput
    }
  });
  
  // Example 4: Specify numeric constraints
  const response4 = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4",
    messages: [
      {role: "user", content: "Provide tips for improving code efficiency"}
    ],
    extra_query: {
      max_latency: 300,    // Maximum 300ms latency
      min_throughput: 15   // Minimum 15 tokens per second
    }
  });
}

main();
```

### cURL Example

```bash
# Example with "best" latency
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_makehub_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
    ],
    "extra_query": {
      "max_latency": "best"
    }
  }'

# Example with numeric constraints
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_makehub_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3-opus",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story about space exploration"}
    ],
    "extra_query": {
      "max_latency": 300,
      "min_throughput": 15
    }
  }'
```

## How Constraint Resolution Works

When multiple constraints are specified, MakeHub will:

1. Filter providers that meet all numeric constraints (if specified)
2. For "best" constraints, rank the remaining providers based on their performance
3. If multiple "best" constraints are specified (e.g., both latency and throughput), MakeHub will find the optimal balance between them

This process ensures that your requests are always routed to providers that best meet your performance requirements.

## Performance Monitoring

To monitor the real-time performance of different providers, check out the [Real-time Metrics Endpoints](/docs/basic-usage/metrics) section. This can help you make informed decisions about which constraints to apply to your requests.
