# Quick Start

This guide will help you get up and running with MakeHub quickly. You'll learn how to create an API key and make your first API calls using different programming languages.

## Create Your API Key

Before making any API calls, you'll need to create an API key:

1. Log in to your account at [makehub.ai](https://makehub.ai)
2. Navigate to [makehub.ai/api-keys](https://makehub.ai/api-keys)
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy and securely store your API key

## Making API Calls

MakeHub is designed as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API. This means you can use the OpenAI client libraries you're already familiar with - just point them to MakeHub's API endpoint instead.

### Python Example

```python
import openai

# Initialize the client with your MakeHub API key
client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="your_makehub_api_key",
    base_url="https://api.makehub.ai/v1"
)

# Create a chat completion request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4",  # Format: provider/model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using a routing platform for AI models?"}
    ]
)

# Print the response
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### TypeScript Example

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

// Initialize the client with your MakeHub API key
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "your_makehub_api_key",
  baseURL: "https://api.makehub.ai/v1"
});

async function main() {
  // Create a chat completion request
  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4",  // Format: provider/model
    messages: [
      {role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {role: "user", content: "What are the benefits of using a routing platform for AI models?"}
    ]
  });
  
  // Print the response
  console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}

main();
```

### cURL Example

```bash
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_makehub_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using a routing platform for AI models?"}
    ]
  }'
```

## How Routing Works

When you make a request without specifying any additional constraints, MakeHub will automatically route your request to the most cost-effective provider. If that provider is unavailable (due to downtime, rate limits, or other issues), MakeHub will automatically fall back to alternative providers to ensure your request is fulfilled.

For more details on the routing mechanism, see the [How Routing Works](/docs/basic-usage/routing) section.

## Model Naming Convention

When using MakeHub, you need to specify both the provider and the model name using the format `provider/model`. For example:

- `openai/gpt-4o`
- `anthropic/claude-3-opus`
- `mistral/mistral-large`

For a complete list of supported models and providers, visit [makehub.ai/models](https://makehub.ai/models).
