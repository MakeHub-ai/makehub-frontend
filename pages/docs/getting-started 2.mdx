# Getting Started with MakeHub

This guide will help you set up your MakeHub account and make your first API call. Follow these simple steps to get started with intelligent model routing in just a few minutes.

## Creating an Account

1. Visit [makehub.ai](https://makehub.ai) and click on "Sign Up"
2. Complete the registration form with your details
3. Verify your email address to activate your account

## Generating Your API Key

1. Log in to your MakeHub account
2. Navigate to [makehub.ai/api-keys](https://makehub.ai/api-keys)
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Development", "Production")
5. Copy your new API key and store it securely - you won't be able to view the full key again

## Setting Up Your Environment

MakeHub is designed to be a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API. This means you can use your existing OpenAI client library and simply change the base URL to point to MakeHub.

### Python Setup

```python
import openai

# Configure the client with your MakeHub API key
client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="your_makehub_api_key",
    base_url="https://api.makehub.ai/v1"  # Use MakeHub instead of OpenAI
)

# Make requests as usual
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4",  # Specify provider/model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### TypeScript Setup

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

// Configure the client with your MakeHub API key
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "your_makehub_api_key",
  baseURL: "https://api.makehub.ai/v1"  // Use MakeHub instead of OpenAI
});

// Make requests as usual
async function main() {
  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4",  // Specify provider/model
    messages: [
      {role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {role: "user", content: "Hello, who are you?"}
    ]
  });
  
  console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}

main();
```

## Making Your First API Call

When making API calls through MakeHub, you'll notice that the model name format includes the provider name as a prefix (e.g., `openai/gpt-4`, `anthropic/claude-3-opus`). This helps MakeHub identify which provider to route your request to.

By default, if you don't specify any additional constraints, MakeHub will route your request to the most cost-effective provider that can fulfill your request.

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up your account and made your first API call, you can:

- Learn about [adding performance constraints](/docs/basic-usage/performance) to optimize routing
- Discover how to [restrict requests to specific providers](/docs/basic-usage/providers)
- Understand [how routing works](/docs/basic-usage/routing) behind the scenes
- Explore the [real-time metrics](/docs/basic-usage/metrics) available for all providers
