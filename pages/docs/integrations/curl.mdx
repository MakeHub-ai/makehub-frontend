# cURL Integration

MakeHub offers full compatibility with the OpenAI API, allowing you to easily use our services via cURL commands for quick testing or custom integrations.

## Basic Configuration

To use MakeHub with cURL, you need to specify the MakeHub endpoint and include your API key in the authorization header.

## Simple Request Example

```bash
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MAKEHUB_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "meta/llama-3-70b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain how machine learning works in simple terms."}
    ]
  }'
```

## Using Streaming

To receive responses in streaming mode (as they are generated):

```bash
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MAKEHUB_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "meta/llama-3-70b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem about artificial intelligence."}
    ],
    "stream": true
  }' --no-buffer
```

## Function Calling

Here's how to perform a function call with cURL:

```bash
curl https://api.makehub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MAKEHUB_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What'\''s the weather like in Paris today?"}
    ],
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "get_weather",
          "description": "Get the current weather for a given location",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The city and country, e.g. '\''Paris, France'\''"
              }
            },
            "required": ["location"]
