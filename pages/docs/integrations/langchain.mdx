# Langchain Integration

[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a popular framework for developing applications powered by language models. MakeHub can be easily integrated with Langchain by using the OpenAI LLM interface with a custom base URL.

## Getting Started

To use MakeHub with Langchain, you'll need to install the Langchain library and OpenAI dependencies:

```bash
pip install langchain openai
```

## Using MakeHub in Langchain

You can integrate MakeHub as a model provider in your Langchain applications by configuring the OpenAI LLM with MakeHub's API endpoint:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Initialize OpenAI LLM with MakeHub endpoint
llm = OpenAI(
    model_name="gpt-4o",  # Specify the model you want to use
    openai_api_key="your_makehub_api_key",
    openai_api_base="https://api.makehub.ai/v1"  # Point to MakeHub API
)

# Create a prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question"],
    template="Answer the following question: {question}"
)

# Create a chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
response = chain.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

## Advanced Configuration

You can specify additional parameters when initializing the LLM:

```python
llm = OpenAI(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    openai_api_key="your_makehub_api_key",
    openai_api_base="https://api.makehub.ai/v1",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1000,
    # Add routing preferences in headers if needed
    # This feature is coming soon
)
```

## Direct MakeHub Integration

A pull request to add direct MakeHub integration to Langchain is currently in progress. Once merged, you'll be able to use MakeHub directly with:

```python
from langchain.llms import MakeHub

llm = MakeHub(
    api_key="your_makehub_api_key",
    model_name="openai/gpt-4o",
    routing_strategy="cost-efficient"
)
```

We'll update this documentation once the integration is available.

## Benefits of Using MakeHub with Langchain

- **Model Flexibility**: Easily switch between different AI models without changing your code
- **Intelligent Routing**: Let MakeHub choose the best model based on your requirements
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across multiple AI providers
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatically route to cost-efficient models when appropriate

For more information on available options and advanced usage, refer to the Langchain documentation.
