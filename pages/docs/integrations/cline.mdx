[Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) is an AI assistant for VS Code specialized in software development, allowing developers to interact with large language models directly from their work environment. You can easily configure Cline to use MakeHub as an intelligent routing service between different AI models.

## Overview

Cline integration with MakeHub allows you to access multiple AI models through a single interface, providing seamless switching between different language models based on your needs.

## Accessing Settings

- Open VS Code
- Click on the model name displayed at the bottom of the VS Code window

## Configuring MakeHub Connection

- Select "OpenAI Compatible" from the API Provider dropdown
- Set Base URL to: `https://api.makehub.ai/v1`
- Enter your MakeHub API key
- Select the model (e.g., "anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet")

With this configuration, Cline will route all your requests through MakeHub, giving you access to multiple AI models through a single interface.
