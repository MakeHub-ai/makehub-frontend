# Roo Code Integration

[Roo Code](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code) is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in your VS Code editor. You can easily configure Roo Code to use MakeHub as an intelligent routing service between different AI models.

## Overview

Roo Code integration with MakeHub allows you to access multiple AI models through a single interface, providing seamless switching between different language models based on your needs.

## Accessing Settings

- Open VS Code
- Click on the Settings (gear icon) in the Roo Code extension panel

## Configuring MakeHub Connection

- In the "AI Provider" section, select "OpenAI Compatible" from the dropdown
- Set Base URL to: `https://api.makehub.ai/v1`
- Enter your MakeHub API key
- Set Model ID to your desired model (e.g., "meta/llama-3-70B-fp8")
- Optional: Check "Set Azure API version" if required for your configuration

With this configuration, Roo Code will route all your requests through MakeHub, giving you access to multiple AI models through a single interface.
