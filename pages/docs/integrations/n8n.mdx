# n8n Integration

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a workflow automation platform that enables connecting various services. This guide explains different methods to integrate MakeHub AI's LLM capabilities with n8n workflows.

## Method 1: Using OpenAI Node with Custom Base URL

The simplest way to use MakeHub in n8n is through the built-in OpenAI node with a modified base URL:

1. Add an **OpenAI** node to your workflow
2. Configure your credentials with:
   - **Base URL**: `https://api.makehub.ai/v1`
   - **API Key**: Your MakeHub API key
3. Select your operation and model as you would with OpenAI
4. Configure your request parameters (prompt, temperature, etc.)

This method leverages MakeHub's API compatibility with OpenAI's interface.

## Method 2: Using MakeHub Custom Node

For advanced features including performance controls and updated model lists, use the dedicated MakeHub node:

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to your n8n directory
cd ~/.n8n

# Install the MakeHub node
npm install n8n-nodes-makehub
```

Alternatively, you can install it through the n8n interface:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**
2. Click **Install a Community Node**
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-makehub` in the package name field
4. Click **Install**

### Configuration

1. Add the **MakeHub AI** node to your workflow
2. Create new credentials with your MakeHub API key
3. Select a model from the dynamically loaded model list
4. Configure message content and parameters
5. Set performance settings:
   - **Min Throughput Mode**: Control token generation speed (tokens/sec)
   - **Max Latency Mode**: Control maximum latency (ms)

### Performance Optimization

The MakeHub node offers three performance modes:
- **Best Price**: Most economical option
- **Custom Value**: Manually set throughput/latency values
- **Best Performance**: Optimized for speed (higher cost)

## Method 3: Direct Integration (Coming Soon)

The MakeHub team is working on a pull request to natively integrate MakeHub capabilities into n8n's core. This will provide deeper integration without requiring custom node installation.

## Example Workflow

Here's a simple workflow example:

1. **HTTP Request** (Trigger) → Receives a prompt from an external source
2. **MakeHub AI** → Processes the prompt with your chosen AI model
3. **Function** → Parses and processes the AI response
4. **Send Email** → Delivers the results

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your API key has sufficient credits
- Check network connectivity to api.makehub.ai
- Verify your model selection is available in your MakeHub subscription
